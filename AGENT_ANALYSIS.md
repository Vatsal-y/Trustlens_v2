# Agent Analysis - Debugging Metrics Flow

## Current Status (from test output)

### ✅ Stage 1: Git-S3 Workflow (WORKING)
- **Metrics Extracted Correctly:**
  - Total LoC: **151** ✅
  - Functions: **13** ✅
  - Classes: **1** ✅
  - Max Depth: **6** ✅

- **Action:** Metrics are aggregated and saved to S3 metadata.json

---

### ❌ Stage 2: Orchestrator (BROKEN)
- **Metrics Received by Routing Policy:**
  - Total LoC: **0** ❌ (Should be 151)
  - Max nesting: **0** ❌ (Should be 6)
  - Avg file size: **0** ❌

---

### ❌ Stage 3: Code Quality Agent (BROKEN)
- **Receives broken metrics from routing policy:**
  - Total LoC: **0** ❌
  - Function Count: **0** ❌
  - Class Count: **0** ❌
  - Max Nesting Depth: **0** ❌

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue is likely in **ONE of these three places:**

1. **S3Reader.get_metadata()** - Not returning the full metadata structure with repo_info
   - The metadata.json is saved correctly in S3
   - But when read back, the structure might be different
   
2. **Orchestrator snippet-only mode** - Not properly extracting repo_info from metadata
   - The code looks correct, but the metadata structure returned by S3Reader might not match our expectations

3. **Routing Policy** - Receiving empty features object
   - The features object created in orchestrator might not have the right structure

## Debugging Steps (Added to Code)

When you run the test again with the updated code, look for these debug logs:

### In S3Reader:
```
📋 Metadata structure:
   Top-level keys: [...]
   repo_info keys: [...]
   repo_info['total_loc']: [VALUE]
```

### In Orchestrator:
```
📋 Metadata Keys: [...]
🔍 Building features from repo_info:
   total_loc: [VALUE]
   function_count: [VALUE]
✅ Features structure created:
   features['features']['total_loc']: [VALUE]
```

### In Routing Policy:
```
🔍 Curating quality metrics:
   raw['total_loc']: [VALUE]
   complexity['function_count']: [VALUE]
✅ Final curated metrics:
   total_loc: [VALUE]
```

---

## How to Identify the Problem

Compare the debug logs:
- If S3Reader shows `total_loc: 0` → **Problem is in git_s3_workflow saving**
- If S3Reader shows `total_loc: 151` but Orchestrator shows `total_loc: 0` → **Problem is in orchestrator reading**
- If Orchestrator shows `total_loc: 151` but Routing Policy shows `total_loc: 0` → **Problem is in routing policy**

## Next Steps

1. Run the test with the updated debug code
2. Share the logs focusing on the three sections above
3. We'll identify exactly where the metrics are being lost
4. Fix that specific component

## Current Agent Status

| Agent | Status | Issue |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Feature Extraction | ✅ Working | Extracts from code correctly |
| Security Analysis | ✅ Working | Uses pre-extracted snippets, works fine |
| Logic Analysis | ✅ Working | Uses pre-extracted snippets, works fine |
| Code Quality | ❌ Broken | Receives metrics = 0 from orchestrator |
| Decision | ✅ Working | Aggregates other agents correctly |

**Main Culprit:** The **Code Quality Agent** is not working because the **Orchestrator** is not passing it the correct metrics.
