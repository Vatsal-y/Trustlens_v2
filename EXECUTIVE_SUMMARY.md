## 🔧 Technical Changes

### Modified Files: 3
```
backend/storage/s3_uploader.py       (+1 new method)
backend/storage/git_s3_workflow.py   (updated upload logic)
backend/storage/s3_reader.py         (+1 new method)
```

### New Methods: 2
- `S3Uploader.upload_only_snippets()`
- `S3Reader.get_metadata()`

### Deprecated Methods: 2
- `S3Uploader.upload_directory()` (with warning)

## 💡 How It Works

### Before (Inefficient)
```
Git Repo (500+ files) → Clone → Upload ENTIRE repo to S3 (500MB)
```

### After (Optimized) ✅
```
Git Repo (500+ files) → Clone → Extract snippets → Upload ONLY snippets to S3 (5MB)
```
